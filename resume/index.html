<div class="blurb">
I want to re-tool my skills and challenge myself in a new way. I am a soon to graduate of the Udacity Grow with Google nano degree program for Android development. I also recently completed a bootcamp for various Web development technologies. I found during both of these programs that my vast industry knowledge in SDLC, Technical Project Management, and Software QA accelerated my skills far above my cohorts. I find myself working on my projects until all hours of the night because I keep coming up with cool features to add. I search until I figure out how to make my ideas come to life. I want to reinvent my self as an app developer. I already understand how the business world works. I’m ready to engage it with a new set of skills.
