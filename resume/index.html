  <h2 id=header-2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>Software Development Project Manager with expertise in Agile, Software Development Lifecycle, Software QA, and hands on Software Development. Best known for effectively leading engineering teams and translating technical information between business users and developers. Strengths include leveraging a unique blend of software development, SQA, and Technical Project Management skills.</p>

  <p>I am re-tooling my skills and challenging myself in a new way. I am a soon to graduate of the Udacity Grow with Google nano degree program for Android development. I also recently completed a bootcamp covering various Web development technologies. I found during both of these programs that my vast industry knowledge in SDLC, Technical Project Management, and Software QA accelerated my skills far above my cohorts. I find myself working on my projects until all hours of the night because I keep coming up with cool features to add. I search until I figure out how to make my ideas come to life. I want to reinvent my self as an app developer. I already understand how the business world works. I’m ready to engage it with a new set of skills.</p>
